#summary PropController Pinouts for Daughterboards.

= PropController Pin-outs =

The PropController has 4 general purpose I/O headers and 1 special purpose I/O header that follows the Parallax MoBo connection standard. Below are the pinouts for both header types. 

= General Purpose I/O =
The header is a 8 pin 1 row connector. Each header contains 4 data I/O, Vin, 5V, 3.3V, and Ground. The data pin assignments are based on header being used. Below is the pin-out for each header:

  # GND
  # Vin
  # Data 1 (P1, P5, P9, P13) 
  # Data 2 (P2, P6, P10, P14)
  # Data 3 (P3, P7, P11, P15)
  # Data 4 (P4, P8, P12, P16)
  # +5V
  # +3.3V

= Special Purpose I/O (MoBo) =
The header is a 12 pin 2 row connector. Each header contains 4 data I/O, EEProm SCL/SDA, TTL TxD/RxD, Vin, 5V, 3.3V, and Ground. Below is the pin-out for the header:

  # GND
  # +3.3V
  # TTL Tx / P31
  # TTL Rx / P30
  # EEProm SCL / P28
  # EEProm SDA / P29
  # P17
  # P18
  # P19
  # P20
  # +5V
  # Vin
