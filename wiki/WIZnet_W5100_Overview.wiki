=WIZnet W5100 IC=

WIZnet is a South Korean company that creates semiconductors for connectivity. More specifically, WIZnet has created a line of integrated circuits that have a hardware based TCP/IP stack and associated embedded Ethernet interface such as MAC and PHY. The Spinneret Web Server project utilizes the W5100 IC from WIZnet.

The W5100 IC product details can be found at the WIZnet [http://www.wiznet.co.kr/Sub_Modules/en/product/Product_Detail.asp?cate1=5&cate2=7&cate3=26&pid=1011 W5100 product page]:

The basics of the W5100 IC include:

    Two types of MCU to W5100 interface - SPI and parallel (indirect address or direct addressing)
    Support Hardwired TCP/IP Protocols TCP, UDP, ICMP, IPv4 ARP, IGMP, PPPoE, Ethernet
    10BaseT/100BaseTX Ethernet PHY embedded
    Support Auto Negotiation (Full-duplex and half duplex)
    Support Auto MDI/MDIX
    Support ADSL connection (with support PPPoE Protocol with PAP/CHAP Authentication mode)
    Supports 4 independent sockets simultaneously
    Internal 16Kbytes Memory for Tx/Rx Buffers
    3.3V operation with 5V I/O signal tolerance 

The PropController utilizes the [http://www.wiznet.co.kr/Sub_Modules/en/product/Product_Detail.asp?cate1=5&cate2=42&cate3=0&pid=1026 WIZnet WIZ812MJ module] which contains a W5100 IC and all the supporting circuitry.
