#summary Assembly Guide for Ethernet PropController

= PropController Ethernet Assembly Instructions =

This is in no way shape or form the only way to assemble a PropController.
Part Numbers referenced are taken from the Ethernet PropController BOM.

== Tips ==

 # Start by checking the PCB for any obvious faults, missing/broken traces, holes that aren't clear, etc.
 # Clean the PCB with Rubbing Alcohol (atleast 70%) or other PCB cleaner. 
 # Get your parts together in order of assembly, and insure you have the correct quantities.

== Board Assembly Instructions ==

=== Power and Zero Cross Detect Assembly ===

 # Install four diodes (D1 - D4) P/N: 1N5817DICT-ND. The diodes have a strip (silver/grey) that must line up with the white silkscreen on the PCB.  (Insert Picture)
 # Install the two 750 Ohm 1/4W (Violet, Green, Brown, Gold) resistors (R 6 - R 7) P/N: 750QBK-ND. 
 # Install the three 10k Ohm 1/4W (Brown, Black, Orange, Gold) resistors (R 4, R 8, R 22) P/N: 10KQBK-ND. 
 # Install the two 47uF capacitors (C2 - C3) P/N: 445-2905-ND. The capacitor _does_ have a polarity. The - - - stripe on the side of the capacitor goes into the Negative lead.
 # Install the four 0.1uF capacitor (C4, C7, C9, C13) P/N: 445-2634-ND.
 # Install the 5V Volt Regulator (VR1) P/N: 497-1404-5-ND. Bend the leads to match the boards foot print. Install the regulator with the tab attached the heat-sink and the heat-sink to the board (don't forget to use thermal grease). 
 # Install the 3.3 Volt Regulator (VR2) P/N: LM2937ET-3.3-ND. Bend the leads to match the boards foot print. Install the regulator with the tab attached the heat-sink and the heat-sink to the board (don't forget to use thermal grease). 
 # Install the Terminal Block (J12) P/N: ED2600-ND. The terminal block gets installed with the holes facing outward.
 # Install the 2200uF capacitor (C1) P/N: P5143-ND. The capacitor _does_ have a polarity. The - - - stripe on the side of the capacitor goes into the Negative lead.
 # Install socket and Zero Crossing chip (VO1) P/N: H11AA1M-ND. The chip gets installed with the indent matching the silkscreen and the dot denoting pin one matching the silkscreen. 

=== Test Power Supply ===

5V, 3.3V, and GND test points are located on the board near the voltage regulators. Using a multimeter test the voltages between 5V and GND, and 3.3V and GND. 

*Do not proceed with assembly if these voltages are out of spec!*

=== Main Board Assembly ===

*Note:* If using SMT USB option install all all surface mount parts first, starting with the USB connector. (See instructions below)

 # Install the Propeller IC (U1) P/N: P8X32A-Q44-ND. (Orientation Note)
 # Install the 2K EEPROM Chip (U6) P/N: 24AA025E48-I/SN-ND (Orientation Note)
 # Install socket and 512K EEPROM Chip (U2) P/N: 24LC512-I/P-ND (Orientation Note)
 # Install the four 150 Ohm 1/4W (Brown, Green, Brown, Gold) resistors (R 1, R 5, R 18, R 19) P/N: 150QBK-ND . 
 # Install the 220 Ohm 1/4W (Red, Red, Brown, Gold) resistor (R 3). P/N: 220QBK-ND. 
 # Install the 33k Ohm 1/4W (Orange, Orange, Orange, Gold) resistor (R 2). P/N: 33KQBK-ND. 
 # Install the 5MHz Crystal (X1) P/N: XC1711-ND. 
 # Install the 3mm Red LED (L1) P/N: 754-1243-ND (Orientation Note)
